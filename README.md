Welcome to my API showcase! This project is designed to highlight my skills in working with APIs, similar to a project I created in my COMP 2408 Web Development course (which I couldn’t use here due to copyright restrictions).

Upon loading the page, it connects with the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to browse trending movies:<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-27 at 4 56 29 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e0a7131-2353-4ebf-b9c6-2fe6396e6e09">
Navigate through the movies using the 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons, and view the latest movie displayed on the right sidebar.

Switching over to the TV Shows section, you'll see a list of popular TV shows, along with the one featuring the latest episode: <img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-27 at 4 56 06 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52669017-73f7-46c4-9339-74f790131d6b">

Looking for your favorite movie or TV show? Just type its name in the search bar and specify whether it's a movie or a TV show, and let the search do the rest!<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-27 at 5 00 35 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47631858-76a5-46a0-99f5-b3ae62148143">

Thank you for exploring my project! I hope this demonstration provides a glimpse into my skills in API integration and web development. Feel free to reach out with any feedback or questions. Happy browsing!
